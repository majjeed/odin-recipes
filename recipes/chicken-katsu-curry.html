    <h1>Chicken Katsu Curry</h1>

    <img src="../images/chicken-katsu-curry.jpg" alt="Chicken Katsu Curry Dish" height="400" width="400">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This katsu chicken curry was introduced to
        Japan by the British more than a century ago
        and has become a favorite dish to make at home.
        This recipe combines a rich curry sauce with
        a crispy, fried chicken cutlet. Serve with
        steamed Japanese rice, red and yellow daikon
        pickles, tonkatsu sauce, soft-boiled eggs,
        and Japanese 7-spice seasoning.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Curry Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3 medium potatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups water, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (3.5 ounce) container curry sauce mix (such as S&B Golden Curry)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apricot jam</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Chicken Katsu</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup peanut oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Make curry sauce: Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook onions in hot oil until soft and
            starting to caramelize, about 8 minutes. Add potatoes and carrots. Pour in water and bring to a boil. Reduce
            heat to low, cover, and cook until potatoes are soft, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li> Remove from heat and stir in curry sauce mix until dissolved. Add ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, jam, and
            soy sauce. Simmer until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, make chicken katsu: Flatten chicken breasts with a kitchen mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.
            Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li> Place flour onto a large plate, add beaten egg to a small plate, and place bread crumbs onto a second large
            plate.
        </li>
        <li> Press chicken into flour to coat, dip in beaten egg, and press in bread crumbs to coat generously.
        </li>
        <li> Heat oil in a large saucepan to 355 degrees F (180 degrees C). Carefully lower breaded cutlets into hot oil
            and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into a cutlet
            should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li> While chicken is cooking, stir curry powder into sauce until incorporated.
        </li>
        <li> Slice chicken into strips and spoon curry sauce over the top to serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
